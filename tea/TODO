TODO
----

- Data pipeline integration
- per project data directories
- fits headers
- observation documents not sent when TelemetryHandler receives ObservationStatusInfo,
	as associated UpdateHandler has not processed last update document (copied file across etc)
        when setObservationFailed/setObservationCompleted is set, so terminate does not count up the right number of
	frames.
- RTML parsing in C version/ers.

DONE
----

- fix http server/ URLs
- check eSTARIO java, aa complains of problem documents breaking the parser at line 40, column 4...
  - added flushes to writeMessage - more testing needed.
