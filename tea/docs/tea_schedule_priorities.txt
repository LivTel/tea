TEA Schedule Priorities
-----------------------

"Comment" is the associated TEA comment (based on the RTML spec???)

Schedule (RTML) priority     PhaseII (ODB)	PhaseII (GUI)
-------------------------------------------------------------
			     5			Urgent
0			     4(RTML3.1a toop!)	Quite urgent(RTML3.1a toop!)
1			     3			High
2			     2			Medium
3			     1			Normal

default(other)		     1			Normal
			     0			Normal
(n/a)			     -2			Background

where
"Schedule (RTML) priority" is the number specified in the RTML:<Schedule priority="n">
"PhaseII (ODB)" is the number stored in the PhaseII database
"PhaseII (GUI)" is what is displayed in the PhaseII GUI

Note:
The PhaseII priority "5" _cannot_ be specified by the TEA but can be specified by the PhaseII GUI as Urgent.
The PhaseII priority "-2" is not available to TEA - these obs are done only if nothing else can be executed
 typically this means very-very bad seeing -if there are a lot of these chaps in the ODB they drown out the
 background monitoring and prevent the seeing determination from being made - which is not a good idea.
Currently "Quite Urgent" cannot be specified in RTML 3.1a either, as "0" equates to TOOP.
