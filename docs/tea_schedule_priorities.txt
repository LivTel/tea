TEA Schedule Priorities
-----------------------

"Comment" is the associated TEA comment (based on the RTML spec???)

Schedule (RTML) priority     PhaseII (ODB)	PhaseII (GUI)
-------------------------------------------------------------
0			     5(RTML3.1a toop!)	Urgent(RTML3.1a toop!)
1			     4			Quite urgent
2			     3			High
3			     2			Medium
4			     1			Normal

default(other)		     1			Normal
			     0			Normal
(n/a)			     -2			Background

where
"Schedule (RTML) priority" is the number specified in the RTML:<Schedule priority="n">
"PhaseII (ODB)" is the number stored in the PhaseII database
"PhaseII (GUI)" is what is displayed in the PhaseII GUI

Note:
The PhaseII priority "-2" is not available to TEA - these obs are done only if nothing else can be executed
 typically this means very-very bad seeing -if there are a lot of these chaps in the ODB they drown out the
 background monitoring and prevent the seeing determination from being made - which is not a good idea.
Currently "Urgent" cannot be specified in RTML 3.1a, as "0" equates to TOOP.
We have recently moved the priorities so RTML 2.2 "0" equates to PhaseII priority "5" (Urgent). 
This is currently different from the FTN and FTS TEAs, where RTML 2.2 "0" 
equates to PhaseII priority "4" (Quite Urgent), and PhaseII priority "5" (Urgent) is not specifiable.

FTN and FTS update (2009/04/20) from email by Eric Hawkins:
------------------

Phase 2 GUI | ODB
---------------------
Background	 | -2
Normal		 | 1
Medium		 | 2
High		 | 3
Urgent		 | 5
Photom		 | -1


Our current RTML priority mappings are:

RTML	| ODB
----------------
0	| 5
1	| 4
2	| 3
3	| 2
4	| 1

So it looks like we match up with the LT except for the fact that 'Quite
Urgent' (ODB priority 4) is not available via our phase2 GUI. Groups
with this priority will show up as priority 'Normal' in our phase2 GUI
since that is the default.

Regarding the SDSS-i filter issue, we already have the generic 'I' filter
mapped to SDSS-i.
