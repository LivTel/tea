There have been several small changes to the RTML since the TEA was last installed on ltproxy.

Schedule Priority
-----------------

The Schedule priority attribute is now parsed by the tea, and it's value actually means something! I believe
you previously mentioned that you already have a priority attribute in your RTML documents? Anyway the syntax is as in the DTD i.e.
<Schedule priority="1">

According to the DTD:
The required priority attribute is an integer: 0=Target-of-Opportunity (highest priority), 
1=high priority, 2=lower priority etc...
NB Target-of-Opportunity is not really toop here, read as "Urgent" in our case.

Probably should be set to 0 for microlensing monitoring and schedulable followup 
(due to the targets low transit altitude), this enhancement really for other projects.

Seeing Constraint
-----------------

It is possible to set a seeing constraint for the observation. e.g. Inside the <Schedule> tag:

<SeeingConstraint minimum="0.3" maximum="1.3"/>

We ignore the minimum seeing, our phaseII database does not have the concept of not doing an observation
because the seeing is too good. If the maximum >= 1.3, we set the group seeing to POOR, if the 
maximum >= 0.8, we set the group seeing to AVERAGE, otherwise we set it to EXCELLENT.

For the microlensing project, this should always be poor. If you don't specify a seeing constraint
it defaults to POOR, so I wouldn't add this tag to your RTML!

TOOP Mode
---------

There is now a mechanism for invoking target of oppurtunity mode on the telescope. This is a session based
system, which takes control of the telescope (rather, the RCS only accepts observations from the TOCA agent 
rather than asking the scheduler for observations). This is usually used at the present time for GRB real-time
followup, we would like to use it eventually for microlensing anomoly followup.

The system is activated by setting the Target type to "toop" rather than "normal" e.g.:

<Target type="toop" ident="r10">

A scoring request with type="toop" checks:
1. The target is above the horizon NOW.
2. The TOOP service id associated with the specified <Project>/<User> information can take control of the telescope
   NOW (e.g. the telescope is operating, it is dark, no higher priority TOOP is already running).

Note a score/request can also be rejected if:
1. There is no mapping from the specified <Project>/<User> information to a TOOP service id. 
   (This information is held in the TEA, not all proposals using the TEA may have the ability to trigger TOOP operations).
2. If a <SeriesConstraint> is present, the document is rejected. TOOP mode only allows flexibly scheduled observations
   (or rather, immediate observations).
3. If a <SeeingConstraint> is present, the document is rejected.
4. If more than one <Observation>  is present, the document is rejected (probably true of "normal" obs as well atm).
5. Other stuff (i.e. No Target node).

When a document of type "request" with a "toop" Target is received, it is added to a list of toop documents
(per Tag/User/Proposal) to be serviced, and a "confirmation" document is returned.

There is basically a thread checking the list of toop documents. This starts a TOCA session on the telescope, slews,
takes the requested data, file transfers to the tea machine, calls the data pipeline on each frame, sends an "update" document for each frame, sends an "observation" document for the document. The TOCA session is then held open for a couple of minutes before the session is terminated, this gives the IA end chance to process the returned data and request more TOCA followups if necessary (if we didn't do this there could be a situation where we terminate the session, the RCS selects an observation from the scheduler which starts a telescope slew, and then the IA decides to send another "toop" document for the target and the telescope has to slew back). 

Of course, none of this is needed until the IA can automatically detect anomolies in the lightcurve, I guess then this becomes useful.

ImageData
---------

The image data tags are now filled in, for both update and observation documents, with:
1. Image data URL.
2. FITS Header.
3. Cluster file (if any) generated by the data pipeline OR a VOTable URL.

Format is something like:
<ImageData type="FITS16" delivery="url" reduced="true">http://150.204.240.8/~estar/data/home/estar/data/c_e_20050511_198_1_1_1.fits</ImageData>
